The dripping tap
Won't be turned off by the
Suits in charge of
The world and our
Futures hanging
On by a thread
With our heads in the sand

Ohhh

The dripping tap
Won't be turned off by the
Gods up above us
Big sky country
That we never
Hear from in these
Times of our dying needs

Wooo
A familiar sound ignored
The compartmentalized thoughts
In the back corner of the drawer
That drip, drip on the floor

Don't get drowned
Hehehe (woo)
Heed that sound
Hehehe
Wooo

Left the tap on
Swamping out of the sink
Left the tap on
Agua flowin' in
Left the tap on
Blankets over my skin
Left the tap on
Wish I learnt how to swim

Left the tap on
Swamping out of the sink
Left the tap on
Agua flowin' in
Left the tap on
Blankets over my skin
Left the tap on
Wooo

Left the tap on
Swamping out of the sink
Left the tap on
Agua flowin' in
Left the tap on
Blankets over my skin
Left the tap on
Wish I learnt how to swim

Left the tap on
Swamping out of the sink
Left the tap on
Agua flowin' in
Left the tap on
Blankets over my skin
Left the tap on
Wooo

The dripping tap
Won't be turned off by the
Suits in charge of
The world and our
Futures hanging
On by a thread
With our heads in the sand

Ooo

Wooo

Everybody's on the same orbit
When they get old and moronic
Get complacent and get bored
That drip, drip on the floor

Don't get drowned
Hehehe (woo)
Heed that sound
Hehehe
Woo
Ooo

Wooo
Left the tap on
Swamping out of the sink
